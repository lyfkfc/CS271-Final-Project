Created two models based on Stochastic local search (SLS) and Branch and Bound (BnB) via Python to optimize paths for Travelling Salesman Problems.

To run bnb with benchmark, paste all the benchmark file to this directory and run:
bash runbnb1.sh
bash runbnb2.sh

Two bash files run small data and large data each and every benchmark has a time limit of 15 minutes.
